## When to use Conviso API

With the Conviso API, you can perform a variety of actions related to application security, such as:

- Project management and its related security activities;

- Analysis and management of vulnerabilities from different sources;

- Management of integrations with other tools and platforms;

- Management of communication and notifications.


As a reminder, you can also allow Conviso access to your development flow using the Conviso Platform [integrations](../integrations/integrations_intro.md) and the [Conviso CLI](../cli/installation.md).

**Note:** There may be differences in output of the Conviso API, the Conviso CLI, and Conviso Platform Integrations. 

## Conviso API GraphQL
We use and recommend using our GraphQL API, it is available for you to try as endpoints are released, see the [documentation here](../api/graphql/introduction.md). Conviso's GraphQL API will replace Conviso's Rest API.

### What is GraphQL?
[GraphQL](https://graphql.org/) is a query language for APIs. It provides a complete and understandable description of the data in your API, gives clients the power to ask for exactly what they need and nothing more, makes it easier to evolve APIs over time, and enables powerful developerÂ tools.

## Conviso API Rest
The Conviso REST API is being deprecated. To ensure optimal performance and access to the latest features, we recommend switching to the GraphQL API for full benefits of updated technology. 

## Getting support for the Conviso API
