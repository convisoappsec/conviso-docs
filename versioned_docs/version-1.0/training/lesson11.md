**Lesson 11 Contents**:

XSS flaws occur whenever an application includes untrusted data in a new web page without proper validation or filtering, or when it updates an existing web page with data submitted by a user via a browser API that can create JavaScript. XSS allows attackers to run scripts in a victim's browser, which can hijack user sessions, de-identify websites or redirect the user to malicious websites.
