We are happy to share with all customers and partners the availability of another release of AppSec Flow - version 3.0.4! 

This release is an additional step towards our strategy of putting Flow at the center of the DevSecOps pipeline, supporting our customers in the implementation of their "secure by design" application building program.

## Main Highlights of version 3.0.4

### New automated creation of vulnerability templates

</div>

It is now easier to create vulnerabilities from the evidence found in their integrations with Conviso's different scanning engines. Select a group of "findings" and use the existing information to create custom templates quickly and efficiently.

### New Integration with Dependency Tracker

</div>

The new integration with Dependency Track allows rapid analysis of dependency composition, allowing customers to track the possible use of insecure components in their applications and act to prevent supply chain attacks.

### New integrated environment for Code Review

Analyze the security of your application deploys quickly and efficiently, contextually considering all elements of evidence of vulnerabilities ("findings") and the affected code snippet itself.

## Performance tweaks and bug fixes

Version 3.0.4 also introduces performance tweaks to the vulnerability filters of its security scans, as well as a number of bug fixes and customer-requested improvements.

## Coming Soon...

The next release (3.0.5) completes the series of improvements implemented in Flow, placing the platform at the center of managing the secure development of your applications. The main milestone will certainly be the availability of native integration with all **N-Stalker** engines and easy control to include these native analysis in your development pipeline.
