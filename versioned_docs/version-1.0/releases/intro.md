## Release notes

Release notes provide technical documentation produced and distributed alongside the launch of a new software product or a product update such as recent changes, feature enhancements, or bug fixes. It very briefly describes a new product or succinctly details specific changes included in a product update, for example:

## Compatibility changes

If the new release introduces changes in compatibility or default behavior, we will highlight them explicitly, describing the cases where the behavior change will be encountered, how to address the change, and what happens if the user doesn't act on the change.

## New features and enhancements

Now is the time to brag about all the cool, new stuff your software does.

## Bug fixes

Because no software is perfect, there are always bugs left unsquashed. This section is the place to list those.
