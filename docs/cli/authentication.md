## Authentication
In order to start using the CLI you will need to provide your API Key for your Conviso Platform account.  When retrieving it, you can export the key as system environment variable:

```bash
export FLOW_API_KEY='you-api-key'
```

Also, the API Key can be set as option argument:
```bash
conviso --api-key 'you-api-key' [SOME COMMAND]
```
>*This is not recommended for production environments*
