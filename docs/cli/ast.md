### Introduction

Protect your code from security threats with our **AST (Application Security Testing)** using Conviso CLI. 

The tool offers both **Static Application Security Testing (SAST)** and **Software Composition Analysis (SCA)** tools, which can be accessed through the Conviso Platform.


### Usage

To trigger this function is very simple, one of the methods is to export the settings to be used by the CLI to environment variables. Below an example:

```bash
export FLOW_API_KEY='your-api-key'
export FLOW_PROJECT_CODE='your-project-code'
cd your_source_code_repository
conviso ast run
```

Or if you prefer to do it in a single command, the instructions below have the same effect:

```bash
conviso --api-key 'your-api-key' ast run \
  --project-code 'your-project-code' \
  --repository-dir 'your_source_code_repository_path'
```

**Note:** To scan your repository with AST, you need to have a project registered on Conviso Platform, the "Project Code" is found on the specific project page. You also need your API Key, you can find it in the [authentication part of this documentation](/cli/installation#authentication).

The identified vulnerabilities will be automatically sent to your Project on Conviso Platform. Now you can use the [Vulnerabilities Management](../general/vulnerabilities_management.md) resource to work on the correction flow.

### Deploy

When running the AST scan with the CLI, a [Deploy](../guides/code-review-strategies.md) creation is automatically performed to send diff code to Conviso Platform security Code Review.

</div>

Thus, it is possible to verify if the code added or changed in the commit has known security vulnerabilities and compare it with the original repository. 

**Note:** This feature is essential for performing Security Code Review by the security team. Conviso offers the continuous code review service, [see more](https://bit.ly/457M2Cb).


## Run scan only with Conviso SAST

As an additional custom configuration of the Conviso CLI, itâ€™s possible to perform SAST-only in your code using the following command:

```bash
export FLOW_API_KEY='your-api-key'
export FLOW_PROJECT_CODE='your-project-code'
cd your_source_code_repository
conviso sast run
```

The following instructions have the same effect:

```bash
cd my_source_code_repository
conviso --api-key 'your-api-key' sast run --project-code 'your-project-code'
```

In case of any results, they will be automatically sent to Conviso Platform for assessment.
