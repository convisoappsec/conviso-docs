## Overview

Imagine that you want to validate your opened vulnerabilities for a specific project and block your [CI/CD] pipeline depending on pre-defined vulnerability policies.
The Security Gate feature helps you with that by letting you define policies such as:
- Vulnerability Quantity by severity (Low, Medium, High, Critical)
- Vulnerability sources (For example, external integrations such as Checkmarx or Qualys, and also [Conviso Platform] scanners)

## How does it work?

First, you need to define the policies for the specific project.
Let us define for this example that a [CI/CD] pipeline needs to be blocked when there is more than 5 high severity vulnerabilities.
If the policy that was defined is true and the asset in fact has more than 5 high severity vulnerabilities, then the Security Gate feature will break the job execution of the pipeline indicating the cause with the details of why it did not pass through.

## Policy File Structure

For the previous example it can be used the following policy rules:

```yml
rules:
- from: any
  severity:
    critical:
      maximum: 0
    high:
      maximum: 5
    medium:
      maximum: 0
    low:
      maximum: 0
```

If you want to avoid validating a specific severity value, you just need to remove it from the rules content. For example, in case you want to validate only critical and high severity:

```yml
rules:
- from: any
  severity:
    critical:
      maximum: 0
    high:
      maximum: 5
```

## Usage
```
conviso vulnerability assert-security-rules --rules-file rules.yml
```

Success Response:
```

âœ… Vulnerabilities security rules assertion finished
```

Failed Response:
```

            }

    }
