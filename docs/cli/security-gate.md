## Introduction
With Conviso CLI's **Security Gate** feature you can define vulnerability policies, such as the number of vulnerabilities by severity and sources, and automatically block your CI/CD pipeline if these policies are not complied, ensuring that your code is secure from potential threats.

### Prerequisites
To successfully run this command [authenticate](/cli/installation#authentication) your machine and set the project key with ```export FLOW_PROJECT_CODE='your-project-code'```. The "Project Code" is found on the specific project page.

## Usage
To use this feature, follow these steps:

### 1. Defining vulnerability policies

First, you need to define the policies for the specific project. This CLI feature helps you with that, allowing you to define policies such as:

- Vulnerability quantity by severity (Low, Medium, High, Critical)

- Vulnerability sources (for example, external integrations such as Checkmarx or Qualys, and also Conviso Platform scanners)

**Note:** It's important to highlight that the definition of vulnerability policies must be defined in the vulnerability management process, considering risk appetite, team maturity and other factors.

### 2. Creating the Security Gate rules in the YAML file
The policy file structure is based on YAML format and can be defined with rules. 

For example, you can define a policy that will block your CI/CD pipeline if there are more than 5 high severity vulnerabilities from any scanners:

```yml
rules:
- from: any
  severity:
    critical:
      maximum: 0
    high:
      maximum: 5
    medium:
      maximum: 0
    low:
      maximum: 0
```

If the policy that was defined is true and the asset in fact has more than 5 high severity vulnerabilities, then the Security Gate feature will break the job execution of the pipeline.

To avoid validating a specific severity value, just remove it from the rules content. 

For example, in case you want to validate only critical and high severity:

```yml
rules:
- from: any
  severity:
    critical:
      maximum: 0
    high:
      maximum: 5
```

Save the file in the repository where the CLI will run and record its name that will be used in the next step.


### 3. Running Security Gate with the CLI
After defining the vulnerability policy file, run the following command:

```
conviso vulnerability assert-security-rules --rules-file 'FILE_NAME.yml'
```

If all vulnerabilities meet the defined policies, you will receive a success response:

```
Starting vulnerabilities security rules assertion
âœ… Vulnerabilities security rules assertion finished
```

However, if any vulnerability does not meet the defined policies, you will receive a failure response:

```
Starting vulnerabilities security rules assertion
ðŸ’¬ Vulnerabilities summary
[
    {
        "from": "any",
        "severity": {
            "high": {
                "quantity": 7
            }
        }
    }
]
Error: Vulnerabilities quantity offending security rules
```
