## Setup Group Mapping Integration

To enable integration with group mapping support in Entra ID, follow the steps below:

1. Within the Conviso Platform SSO application, ensure that the fields highlighted below are created.

<div style={{textAlign: 'center'}}>

![img](../../static/img/entra-id-img14.png)

</div>

:::note
Make sure that the claim `name` is mapped to the attribute corresponding to the email the user uses to log in.
:::

2. Assign users to the Entra ID group.

3. [Create a Team](../platform/user-management.md) in the Conviso Platform, specifying the desired Profile and Access Type for the group's users.

4. Retrieve the Entra ID group ID.

5. In the Entra ID integration page within the Conviso Platform, select the Team you created and associate it with the Entra ID group ID.

<div style={{textAlign: 'center'}}>

![img](../../static/img/entra-id-img15.png)

</div>

6. Click **Save**.

This setup simplifies user management, as permissions and access will be managed through the Team, while users are managed via Entra ID.

:::note
Users must be invited to the Conviso Platform beforehand to be able to log in.
:::

You are now ready to go. To log in again with an email from the domain specified in the integration, use the **SSO Access** option on the [Conviso Platform website](https://app.convisoappsec.com/).

Note: Also consult the [Microsoft Documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/saas-apps/appsec-flow-sso-tutorial) for further guidance. There you will find a similar tutorial to help you.

## Email Field Mapping in SAML 2.0 for Microsoft Entra ID
When configuring the Microsoft Entra ID SSO integration via SAML, it's essential to ensure that the email field is correctly mapped. The email configured in your Microsoft Entra ID identity provider must match the email of the logged-in user on the Conviso Platform to ensure proper authentication.

To do this, in the **Attributes & Claims** section, make sure that the `name` (http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/ws/2005/05/identity/claims/name) is mapped to the attribute corresponding to the email the user uses to log in:

<div style={{textAlign: 'center', maxWidth: '80%' }}>

![img](../../static/img/entra-id-img16.png)

</div>

:::note
The `user.userprincipalname` attribute is not mandatory. Just make sure you're using the email the user uses to log in.
:::

### How this works:
During the SSO authentication process, the email is used as the primary identifier to map the user's identity in the Conviso Platform. This means the email value provided by the Microsoft Entra ID identity provider in the SAML Assertion must match exactly with the user's email in Conviso. If it doesn't match, login may fail.

Therefore, when configuring Microsoft Entra ID as the identity provider, make sure the email field is mapped correctly and matches the email associated with the user's account in the Conviso Platform.
