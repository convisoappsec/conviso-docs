## Introduction

The integration of Conviso Platform with the Slack tool aims to help monitor those who are managing activities and don't want to miss anything at the timeline. This integration generates 3 types of alerts directly in the channel of the development team or the manager, with the benefits listed below:

1. When comments/questions are added in the Security Experts tab of a project, an alert is generated directly in the Slack channel;

2. When comments/questions are added to the vulnerability Security Experts tab;

3. When a new vulnerability is identified.

## Conviso Platform integration with Slack

In this guide, we will integrate Conviso Platform with Slack, so that you can receive notification of each action taken in Conviso Platform. 

:::note
You must have Workspace Admin privileges on Slack in order to create this integration.

First, we need to create an "App" in Slack. Click on [Create App](https://api.slack.com/apps/new) to open the following screen, then select the **From Scratch** option:

A new floating window will open. Label the new application as you wish. At the **App Name** field and select your Workspace where you want to create your application, from the drop-down list at **Pick a workspace to develop your app in** option. When done, click at the **Create App** button:

After finishing the integration, we can add a test comment in the Security Experts tab of the Project, and a notification will be generated in the Slack channel with the same message added in Conviso Platform, as shown below:
