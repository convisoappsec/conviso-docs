## Introduction

Integrating ServiceNow in Conviso Platform will let developers gain productivity while we do all the hard work by automating the whole vulnerability management triage process.

New vulnerabilities identified in Conviso Platform are created in real time directly in ServiceNow.

With our two-way integration capability, every status update from both solutions are automatically updated in order to reduce the toil and increase productivity.

### Prerequisites

To set up the integration, you'll need the following information:

1. A user with **Admin permissions in ServiceNow**.
2. A user with **Admin permissions in Conviso Platform**.
3. Your **ServiceNow instance URL** (e.g., `https://your-instance.service-now.com`).
4. **OAuth 2.0 Application** configured in ServiceNow with:
   - Client ID
   - Client Secret
   - Redirect URL configured in ServiceNow

## Usage

To seamlessly integrate Conviso Platform with ServiceNow, follow these step-by-step procedures:

**[1 - Configure OAuth Application in ServiceNow](#configure-oauth-application-in-servicenow)**

**[2 - Configure the integration between Conviso Platform and ServiceNow](#configure-the-integration-between-conviso-platform-and-servicenow)**

## Configure OAuth Application in ServiceNow

Before starting the integration in Conviso Platform, you need to configure an OAuth 2.0 application in your ServiceNow instance.

**Step 1** - Access your ServiceNow instance and navigate to **Application Registries**. You can find this by going to **All** > **System OAuth** > **Application Registries**:

</div>

**Step 2** - Click the **New** button to create a new OAuth application. This will open the OAuth client application configuration form:

<div style={{textAlign: 'center'}}>

</div>

**Step 3** - Fill in the OAuth client application details:

- **Name**: Enter a unique name (e.g., "Conviso Platform")
- **Client ID**: This will be automatically generated by ServiceNow OAuth server
- **Client Secret**: Leave it empty for auto-generation, or provide your own secret
- **Redirect URL**: Enter the redirect URL: `https://app.convisoappsec.com/spa/callback/servicenow`
- **Refresh Token Lifespan**: Time in seconds the Refresh Token will be valid (default: 8,640,000 seconds = 100 days)
- **Access Token Lifespan**: Time in seconds the Access Token will be valid (default: 1,800 seconds = 30 minutes)
- **Active**: Check this box to activate the application

**Step 4** - Click **Update** to save the OAuth application configuration.

**Step 5** - Copy the **Client ID** and **Client Secret** - you will need these in the next step when configuring the integration in Conviso Platform.

## Configure the integration between Conviso Platform and ServiceNow

**Step 1** - Access the **Conviso Platform**, look for **Integrations** on the left-side menu, select **Defect Tracking**, and finally, click the **Connect** button located just below the ServiceNow card, as shown in the example image below:

<div style={{textAlign: 'center'}}>

![img](../../static/img/servicenow/servicenow-img3.png  'ServiceNow integration page')

</div>

**Step 2** - In the **Login** section, enter your **ServiceNow Instance URL** (e.g., `https://your-instance.service-now.com`), **Client ID**, and **Client Secret** that you obtained from the OAuth application configuration in ServiceNow. Then, click the **Log in with ServiceNow** button to authenticate:

<div style={{textAlign: 'center'}}>

![img](../../static/img/servicenow/servicenow-img2.png  'ServiceNow login page')

</div>

**Step 3** - On the ServiceNow authorization page, grant the necessary permissions so the Conviso Platform application can perform the required actions on your ServiceNow instance:

<div style={{textAlign: 'center'}}>

![img](../../static/img/servicenow/servicenow-img-auth.png  'ServiceNow authorization page')

</div>

**Step 4** - After successful authentication, you will be redirected back to Conviso Platform. The **Login** step will show a checkmark, and you'll see the **Configuration** section. This section displays the list of ServiceNow Projects that are paired with Conviso Platform Assets. Initially, this list may be empty:

<div style={{textAlign: 'center'}}>

![img](../../static/img/servicenow/servicenow-img5.png  'ServiceNow configuration page')

</div>

**Step 5** - Click on the **Add Project** button to start pairing a Conviso Platform Asset with a ServiceNow project:

<div style={{textAlign: 'center'}}>

![img](../../static/img/servicenow/servicenow-img5.png  'ServiceNow Add Project button')

</div>

**Step 6** - In the **Add new Project** modal, configure the following fields in order:

1. **Asset**: Select the Asset in Conviso Platform that you want to associate with a ServiceNow project.

2. **ServiceNow Project**: Select the ServiceNow project (e.g., Incident, Problem, Change Request, or custom projects that extend the `task` table).

3. **Status Mapping**: Map Conviso Platform statuses to corresponding ServiceNow statuses. Only the **Identified** status is required; all other fields are optional:
   - **Identified** → Map to the initial ServiceNow status (e.g., "Open")
   - **In progress** → Map to a work-in-progress status (e.g., "Work in Progress")
   - **Awaiting Validation** → Map to a pending status (e.g., "Pending")
   - **Risk Accepted** → Map to a closed status (e.g., "Closed Complete")
   - **False positive** → Map to a closed incomplete status (e.g., "Closed Incomplete")

4. **Severity Mapping**: Configure how vulnerability severities map to ServiceNow priorities. ServiceNow has its own built-in rule for calculating priority based on **Impact** and **Urgency** values. When you select a severity (e.g., "Critical"), the system automatically saves the corresponding Impact and Urgency values so that ServiceNow calculates the priority correctly:
   - **Critical**: Impact 1, Urgency 1
   - **High**: Impact 1, Urgency 2
   - **Medium**: Impact 2, Urgency 2
   - **Low**: Impact 3, Urgency 2

   This mapping ensures that when a vulnerability with "Critical" severity is created in ServiceNow, the Impact and Urgency fields are automatically set to the values that result in a "Critical" priority according to ServiceNow's own calculation rules. You can customize these mappings according to your organization's needs.

</div>

Once everything is configured, click **Save**:

**Step 7** - After saving your integration settings, you will see the newly configured project in the list. You can review, update, or delete the configuration by clicking the **Edit** icon (pencil) to make changes, or the **Trash** icon to permanently delete the integration:

</div>

**Step 8** - Whenever a new vulnerability is detected, it will be automatically sent to the linked ServiceNow project. The issue will be created with the format `[CONVISO] {Issue ID} - {Vulnerability Title}` in the short description. You can view all created vulnerabilities in your ServiceNow instance:

<div style={{textAlign: 'center'}}>

</div>

**Step 9** - You can verify the connection status at any time by clicking the **Check connection** button in the Configuration section. This will test the connection between Conviso Platform and your ServiceNow instance to ensure everything is working correctly:
