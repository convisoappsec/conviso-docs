## Introduction

Conviso Platform integrations are designed to connect security with delivery, not isolate it.  
Instead of forcing teams to change their existing stack, Conviso plugs into the tools they already use and transforms disconnected security data into one operational workflow.

When integrations are configured well, teams gain:

- Faster vulnerability triage with context from code, pipeline, and business scope.
- Less manual handoff between security and engineering teams.
- Better governance through consistent, auditable processes.
- Stronger adoption because security runs where teams already work.

## Integration Categories

To simplify management, integrations are organized by category.  
Use the sidebar to access each category and select the tool that matches your environment.

### Authentication / SSO

Centralize identity and access with your enterprise provider so teams can adopt the platform with secure and scalable authentication.

### CI/CD

Embed security checks into delivery pipelines to automate analysis, enforce standards, and provide feedback at the pace of development.

### Application Lifecycle Management

Connect source-control and lifecycle workflows to keep pull requests, repositories, and security automation aligned with day-to-day engineering delivery.

### Defect / Bug Tracking

Synchronize vulnerabilities with issue management tools to keep remediation inside engineering workflows and improve ownership visibility.

### Developer Portal

Integrate developer portal experiences to expose security context where engineering teams discover services, ownership, and operational standards.

### Notifications

Route relevant security updates to collaboration channels so teams can react quickly to risk changes, gate failures, and remediation events.

### Scanners and Security Sources

Aggregate findings from external scanners and pentest tooling to create a unified vulnerability lifecycle and reduce operational fragmentation.

### Data Analytics

Export and model security data for custom reporting, trend analysis, and executive visibility across teams, products, and business units.

## How to Choose the Right Integrations

Prioritize integrations in this order:

1. Identity and access (SSO) to enable safe adoption.
2. CI/CD, Application Lifecycle Management, and scanners to ensure technical coverage.
3. Defect tracking and notifications to operationalize remediation.
4. Developer portal and analytics integrations to improve governance and decision quality.
