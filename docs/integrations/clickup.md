## Introduction

Easily integrate ClickUp as an Issue Tracking tool and gain automation as well as productivity for your developer's team!

With this integration you will be able to connect a ClickUp workspace and lists, including the ability to configure custom attribute mapping and achieve a two-way integration with Conviso Platform. This two-way integration feature allows information, for example like status updates to be sent back and forth between ClickUp and Conviso Platform. This enables automation, saving time by reducing manual interaction on your behalf.

With this integration, your developers will gain productivity by getting notified with new ClickUp tasks when vulnerabilities are identified.
