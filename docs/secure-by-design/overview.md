## Introduction
Secure by Design automates the Threat Modeling process, defining security requirements and recommending secure coding practices based on threats identified in architectural items.

Built into Conviso Platform, it provides a unified view of threats and facilitates requirements validation and tracking.

This hands-on implementation of the "Shift-Left" and "Secure Design" approach strengthens application security from the initial design phase. 

## Application Security Requirements and Threat Modeling (ASRTM)
The Secure by Design product is a solution that emerges from the ASRTM approach. Application Security Requirements and Threat Modeling, automates the creation of security requirements and models for applications. 

These tools integrate with SDLC, highlighting risks and recommending secure coding practices. They shift security to early development stages, reducing effort and benefiting stakeholders. 

ASRTM aligns security requirements with threat models, improving application security and integrating with risk management systems.

By exploring our content, you'll find resources to help you understand the importance of Threat Modeling:

[Secure By Design – Building secure applications:](https://bit.ly/3qiUDSv) Performing Threat Modeling is a guarantee that your application is more secure, as it will identify scenarios that may allow an attacker to compromise or even cause some damage to the application. 

[3 Benefits of Threat Modeling:](https://bit.ly/3oLi2eG) In this post the approach is on the benefits that might not be directly visualized when applied to Threat Modeling. 

[What Is Threat Modeling:](https://bit.ly/3q8JlQw) Why should we think about Threat Modeling? During the software development process, some steps must be observed so the final result is truly a secure application and is able to reach all established requisites.

[Threat Modeling – What is it and why developers should learn about it:](https://bit.ly/43x9w1F) Within the process of building software, understanding its functionality, and identifying possible security requirements is a key function. That can be a huge difference between your software becoming secure or not. This article aims to introduce development teams to the concept of Threat Modeling.
