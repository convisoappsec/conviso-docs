## Introduction

To start your experience with the Conviso Platform, you need to onboard your applications. This can be done through several approaches:

- Permorming a [Conviso AST](#performing-conviso-ast) scan;
- Integration with an [External Scanner](#integrating-with-an-external-scanner) (e.g., Checkmarx, Dependency-Track, Fortify, SonarQube, SonarCloud).

### Performing Conviso AST

One way to onboard your applications into the Conviso Platform is by executing a Conviso AST scan. This functionality enables you to create an Asset on the platform and run analyses such as SAST, SCA, IaC, secrets detection, and SBOM generation.

To perform a Conviso AST scan, you need to configure a new task in your CI/CD environment. The Conviso Platform integrates seamlessly with many CI/CD tools. The next step is to choose your CI/CD tool from the options below:

* **[AWS Codebuild](../integrations/aws-codebuild.md)**
* **[Azure Pipelines CLI Mode](../integrations/azure-pipelines-cli.md)**
* **[Azure Pipelines Graph Mode](../integrations/azure-pipelines-graph.md)**
* **[Bitbucket Pipelines](../integrations/bitbucket-pipelines.md)**
* **[CircleCI](../integrations/circleci.md)**
* **[Codefresh](../integrations/codefresh.md)**
* **[GitHub Actions](../integrations/github-actions.md)**
* **[GitLab](../integrations/gitlab.md)**
* **[Jenkins](../integrations/jenkins.md)**
* **[Jenkins Single Pipeline for Multiple Repositories using Webhooks](../integrations/jenkins-single-pipeline.md)**

Additionally, you can also bring your applications into the platform using the Conviso CLI. [Click here](../cli/ast.md) to learn how.

#### Observing Scan Execution

Whenever Conviso AST runs, you can monitor its results through the log. From there, you can see how many SAST, SCA, and IaC vulnerabilities were found in that specific scan, how many vulnerabilities have been fixed, and track how many were resolved in the current execution.

If any issues arise during the scan execution, they will also be visible in the log. Should this happen, please contact our support team to have the issue resolved.

### Integrating with an External Scanner

You can onboard your applications into the Conviso Platform by integrating with an External Scanner. This functionality allows you to import applications and vulnerabilities from other tools.

To integrate with an External Scanner, select your desired tool below:

* **[Checkmarx](../integrations/checkmarx.md)**
* **[Dependency-Track](../integrations/dependency-track.md)**
* **[Fortify](../integrations/fortify.md)**
* **[SonarCloud](../integrations/sonarcloud.md)**
* **[SonarQube](../integrations/sonarqube.md)**

Once the integration is complete, return to the [Quickstart](./developer-quickstart.md#receiving-security-notifications) to continue your journey.
