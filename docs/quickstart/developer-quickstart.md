## Introduction

Conviso Platform offers a practical and integrated experience to track the full application security lifecycle. From vulnerability creation to resolution, the platform streamlines continuous risk detection, tracking, and remediation. With notifications in communication tools like Slack and Teams, integration with defect tracking systems, and a detailed view of assets and the SBOM (Software Bill of Materials), developers gain full visibility and control over application vulnerabilities. This empowers development teams to work efficiently and consistently, strengthening their ability to build secure applications.

Follow the steps below to gain a practical and integrated experience with the features that will be most present in your daily workflow as a developer.

## How to Bring Vulnerabilities into the Conviso Platform

To bring vulnerabilities into the Conviso Platform, different approaches can be taken:
- Execution of Conviso AST via [CLI](../cli/ast.md) or [CI/CD tool](../integrations/integrations_intro#conviso-platform-cicd-integration);
- Integration with an [External Scanner](../../integrations/integrations_intro/) (e.g., Checkmarx, Dependency-Track, Fortify, SonarQube, SonarCloud);
- Execution of [Conviso DAST](../security-suite/conviso-dast/conviso-dast.md);
- Importing vulnerabilities from a [SARIF file](../cli/findings.md);
- Manual registration of vulnerabilities.

## Create a Vulnerability Using Conviso AST

Your journey on the platform will begin the moment a vulnerability is created. To do this, letâ€™s create a vulnerability. You can achieve this by copying the code below and pasting it into your IDE in a new file named "vulnerable.js":

```js
const SECRET = 'my-secret';
```

With the vulnerability added to the code, simply commit your code to trigger the analysis by Conviso AST. At this point, your company has likely already set up the scan to run in the pipeline, but an example YAML for GitHub Actions is shown below:

```yaml
name: CI
on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main ]

jobs:
  conviso-ast:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    container:
      image: convisoappsec/convisocli
      env:
        CONVISO_API_KEY: ${{secrets.CONVISO_API_KEY}}
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Run AST
        run: conviso ast run --vulnerability-auto-close
```

The code above is responsible for executing Conviso AST, which performs SAST, SCA, IaC analysis, secret detection, and generates the SBOM. You can find examples of other tools [here](../integrations/integrations_intro.md#conviso-platform-cicd-integration).

## Observe Scan Execution

Whenever Conviso AST runs, you can monitor its results through the log. From there, you can see how many SAST, SCA, and IaC vulnerabilities were found in that specific scan, how many vulnerabilities have been fixed, and track how many were resolved in the current execution.

```code
Run conviso ast run --vulnerability-auto-close

If any issues arise during the scan execution, they will also be visible in the log. Should this happen, please contact our support team to have the issue resolved.

## Observe the vulnerability notification on Slack/Teams

To help users stay aware of risks associated with the company, Conviso Platform provides integration with Slack and Microsoft Teams for sending notifications. For instance, when a vulnerability has just been created, you can be alerted about this event in one of the mentioned tools. Below is an example of how the vulnerability notification appears in Slack:

<div style={{textAlign: 'center'}}>

![img](../../static/img/quickstart/developer1.png)

</div>

## View Vulnerability Information in a Defect Tracker Tool

Conviso Platform integrates with various Defect Tracking tools so that developers can access vulnerability details without disrupting their usual workflow. This allows for the automatic transfer of vulnerabilities from Conviso Platform to tools like Jira, Azure Boards, or Businessmap, ensuring seamless integration.

Once a vulnerability is created in the Defect Tracking tool via Conviso Platform, a bidirectional communication system comes into play. If the status of the vulnerability is updated on Conviso Platform, the change will be reflected in the external tool immediately. Likewise, if the status is first modified in the external tool, the update will be promptly synchronized back to Conviso Platform.

The image below shows an example of a Conviso Platform vulnerability sent to Jira: 

<div style={{textAlign: 'center'}}>

![img](../../static/img/quickstart/developer2.png)

</div>

## View Assets

All scan information is linked to Assets in Conviso Platform. An Asset could be an application, a microservice, or a repository, for instance. To view your Assets, click on "Asset Management" in the sidebar. By default, the Assets are listed from highest to lowest Risk Score.

:::note
Risk Score provides a holistic view of an asset's risk based on factors such as open vulnerabilities, attack surface, business impact, and data classification. Understanding the real risk of each asset is crucial for informed decision-making and prioritizing security efforts.
:::

<div style={{textAlign: 'center'}}>

![img](../../static/img/quickstart/developer3.png)

</div>

Typically, Asset names will match the repository name, but they can be customized.

To see more details about an Asset, simply click on its name.

## View Vulnerability Information on the Platform

Finally, the details of vulnerabilities can also be viewed directly on Conviso Platform. There are two main ways to access this information:

- Viewing from an Asset's detail page
- Viewing from the sidebar menu.

### Viewing from an Asset's Detail Page

On the Asset detail page, simply click on the "Open Vulnerabilities" button, as highlighted in the image below:

<div style={{textAlign: 'center'}}>

![img](../../static/img/quickstart/developer4.png)

</div>

This action will filter for all Asset vulnerabilities with the status Identified, In Progress, or Awaiting Validation. From there, locate the relevant vulnerability and click on its title.

### Viewing from the Sidebar Menu

Alternatively, you can navigate via the sidebar by clicking on "Vulnerabilities," as shown in the image below:

<div style={{textAlign: 'center'}}>

![img](../../static/img/quickstart/developer5.png)

</div>

This will display all vulnerabilities with the status Identified, In Progress, or Awaiting Validation. Locate the relevant vulnerability and click on its title. To simplify your search, filters are available for creation date, asset name, asset tags, vulnerability type, and many other options.

When you have multiple vulnerabilities in your company, the Risk Context Prioritization Funnel will assist you in prioritizing vulnerabilities. For this, it is necessary to have previously configured the **Business Impact**, **Attack Surface** and **Data Classification** information in [Asset Management](../platform/asset-management.md). Notice that, in the example shown in the image below, there are 1,552 Open Vulnerabilities, but only 167 have a High Business Impact, are exposed to the Internet, and deal with or store Sensitive Data:

<div style={{textAlign: 'center'}}>

![img](../../static/img/quickstart/developer9.png)

</div>

This way, you can easily prioritize which vulnerabilities should be fixed. To do this, simply click on the line related to **Sensitive Data**, as indicated below:

<div style={{textAlign: 'center'}}>

![img](../../static/img/quickstart/developer10.png)

</div>

Once you've accessed the vulnerability, you can view general information such as description, solution, and references. Depending on the vulnerability type, you may also find the vulnerable code snippet, file name, and line number. Other types of vulnerabilities may display different details, like the request made to exploit the vulnerability and the server's response, for example.

## View SBOM Information

An SBOM (Software Bill of Materials) is a detailed list of all components, libraries, and dependencies used in an application. It is crucial for building secure applications as it helps identify potential vulnerabilities and ensures transparency in software composition.

When accessing an Asset, you can view its SBOM by clicking the View all button:

<div style={{textAlign: 'center'}}>

![img](../../static/img/quickstart/developer6.png)

</div>

Here, you can explore your Assetâ€™s dependencies, including details like component version, technology, license, package manager, associated CVEs, and open vulnerabilities for each component.

<div style={{textAlign: 'center'}}>

![img](../../static/img/quickstart/developer7.png)

</div>

## Fix Vulnerability

Once you understand how to address the vulnerability with support from the Conviso Platform, the next step is to identify the vulnerable file and line, which is information also provided by the platform. After that, simply apply the fix and follow your organizationâ€™s process for submitting code to the remote repository.

At this stage, there are different paths depending on how the vulnerability was identified:

### Vulnerability Identified by Conviso AST

If the vulnerability was detected by Conviso AST, the next scan run will recognize the fix and automatically change the status of the vulnerability to **Fixed**.

Ensure the command used to run the scan includes the `--vulnerability-auto-close` parameter.

### Vulnerability Identified by Conviso DAST

If the vulnerability was detected by Conviso DAST, the next scan run will similarly identify the fix and automatically update the status to **Fixed**.

### Vulnerability Identified Manually (e.g., via pentest)

If the vulnerability was found manually, such as during a pentest, you should change its status to Awaiting Validation. The Conviso security team will then retest the vulnerability to confirm whether it has been fully resolved or if it can still be exploited.

If the vulnerability is indeed fixed, a Conviso specialist will update the status to **Fixed**. If it remains exploitable, it will revert to its previous status.

### Vulnerability Identified by External Scanners

If the vulnerability was found using an external scanner and imported into Conviso via integration, the external tool must confirm the fix. Once that happens, the next sync with Conviso Platform will update the status to **Fixed**.

## Viewing Closed Vulnerability Notification on Slack/Teams

Once a vulnerability has been fixed, you can receive a notification via Slack, Microsoft Teams, email, or directly on the Conviso Platform. Below is an example of how the closed vulnerability notification appears in Slack:

<div style={{textAlign: 'center'}}>
