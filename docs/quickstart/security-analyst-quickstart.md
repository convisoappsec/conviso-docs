</div>

## Enable Notifications

To stay updated on everything happening in the Conviso Platform, you can enable notifications to be alerted as soon as a vulnerability is identified or fixed, when an Asset is created, when there is a change in an Asset's Risk Score, or when you receive a new message from the Security Expert. This can be set up through tools like Slack and Microsoft Teams, but you can also receive notifications via email or directly on the Conviso Platform.

By enabling notifications, a Security Analyst can quickly respond to emerging security concerns, monitor the status of critical assets in real time, and ensure that the development team is aware of and can address security issues efficiently, fostering proactive and continuous application security.

[Click here](../../integrations/integrations_intro#communication-and-notification) to enable notifications through integrations or [click here](https://app.convisoappsec.com/spa/user/notifications-center) to activate email/in-app notifications.

## View Assets

An Asset refers to any entity that can be evaluated for security purposes. This includes applications, microservices, repositories, or any software component that is subject to security analysis. Assets serve as the foundational elements within the platform, linking scan results, vulnerabilities, risk scores, and related security data. By managing assets effectively, users can track and prioritize security efforts based on factors such as business impact, attack surface, and data classification.

All scan information is linked to Assets in Conviso Platform. An Asset could be an application, a microservice, or a repository, for instance. To view your Assets, click on "Asset Management" in the sidebar. By default, the Assets are listed from highest to lowest Risk Score.

:::note
Risk Score provides a holistic view of an asset's risk based on factors such as open vulnerabilities, attack surface, business impact, and data classification. Understanding the real risk of each asset is crucial for informed decision-making and prioritizing security efforts.
:::

<div style={{textAlign: 'center'}}>

![img](../../static/img/quickstart/developer3.png)

</div>

To see more details about an Asset, simply click on its name.

From the Asset details page, you can [schedule a DAST execution](../security-scans/conviso-dast/conviso-dast.md), view the [vulnerabilities](../platform/vulnerabilities.md), the [SBOM](../security-scans/conviso-sbom/conviso-sbom.md), the [Risk Score](#understanding-risk-score), and various other information.

## Understanding Risk Score

The Risk Score on Conviso Platform is a crucial metric that enables Security Analysts to prioritize and address potential security issues effectively. It evaluates the risk of each Asset by analyzing key factors: Business Impact, Threats, Attack Surface, and Data Classification.
- Business Impact reflects the criticality of an Asset, determined by indicators such as developer activity.
- Threats represent the active vulnerabilities associated with the Asset.
- Attack Surface assesses the exposure level, considering if the Asset is accessible over the internet.
- Data Classification identifies whether the Asset handles sensitive data, like PII.

With this comprehensive view, Security Analysts can understand the overall security posture, track changes over time, and focus on actions to mitigate risks. The visibility of top high-risk and improving Assets, along with guidance on how to reduce risk, supports efficient and informed decision-making.

## View Vulnerability Information on the Platform

Finally, the details of vulnerabilities can also be viewed directly on Conviso Platform. There are two main ways to access this information:

- Viewing from an Asset's detail page
- Viewing from the sidebar menu.

### Viewing from an Asset's Detail Page

On the Asset detail page, simply click on the "Open Vulnerabilities" button, as highlighted in the image below:

<div style={{textAlign: 'center'}}>

![img](../../static/img/quickstart/developer4.png)

</div>

This action will filter for all Asset vulnerabilities with the status Identified, In Progress, or Awaiting Validation. From there, locate the relevant vulnerability and click on its title.

### Viewing from the Sidebar Menu

Alternatively, you can navigate via the sidebar by clicking on "Vulnerabilities," as shown in the image below:

<div style={{textAlign: 'center'}}>

![img](../../static/img/quickstart/developer5.png)

</div>

This will display all vulnerabilities with the status Identified, In Progress, or Awaiting Validation. Locate the relevant vulnerability and click on its title. To simplify your search, filters are available for creation date, asset name, asset tags, vulnerability type, and many other options.

### Risk Context Prioritization Funnel

With the vulnerabilities identified and the Risk Score information configured, the Risk Context Prioritization Funnel can assist you in prioritizing which vulnerabilities to remediate first. It considers Open Vulnerabilities and narrows them down through a series of criteria that increase the risk these vulnerabilities pose to your company. This includes filtering for assets with High Business Impact, those exposed to the internet, and those that handle or store sensitive data. 

In the example below, 1,552 vulnerabilities were initially considered. After applying the funnel, only 167 vulnerabilities matched the filters. Finally, the remaining vulnerabilities are sorted by severity, from highest to lowest.

<div style={{textAlign: 'center'}}>

![img](../../static/img/quickstart/developer9.png)
