## Introduction

Conviso Platform offers a practical and integrated experience to track the full application security lifecycle. From vulnerability creation to resolution, the platform streamlines continuous risk detection, tracking, and remediation. With notifications in communication tools like Slack and Teams, integration with defect tracking systems, and a detailed view of assets and the SBOM (Software Bill of Materials), developers gain full visibility and control over application vulnerabilities. This empowers development teams to work efficiently and consistently, strengthening their ability to build secure applications.

Follow the steps below to gain a practical and integrated experience with the features that will be most present in your daily workflow as a manager.

## Understanding Security Feed

The Security Feed is an essential feature of the [Conviso Platform](https://cta-service-cms2.hubspot.com/web-interactives/public/v1/track/redirect?encryptedPayload=AVxigLKtcWzoFbzpyImNNQsXC9S54LjJuklwM39zNd7hvSoR%2FVTX%2FXjNdqdcIIDaZwGiNwYii5hXwRR06puch8xINMyL3EXxTMuSG8Le9if9juV3u%2F%2BX%2FCKsCZN1tLpW39gGnNpiLedq%2BrrfmYxgh8G%2BTcRBEWaKasQ%3D&webInteractiveContentId=125788977029&portalId=5613826), designed to provide users with real-time AppSec insights and actionable information related to their application security.

It serves as a centralized hub of knowledge, helping users understand the current state of their company's security and guiding them on what actions to enhance to [improve their application security](https://blog.convisoappsec.com/afinal-o-que-e-seguranca-de-aplicacoes/). 

In the Security Feed, you can observe information such as the company's Risk Score, assets with the highest Risk Score, open vulnerabilities, and project statuses. This provides a quick and comprehensive view of the most critical security concerns, empowering teams to prioritize their efforts effectively and take proactive measures to reduce risk.

### Enable Notifications

To stay updated on everything happening in the Conviso Platform, you can enable notifications to be alerted as soon as a vulnerability is identified or fixed, when an Asset is created, when there is a change in an Asset's Risk Score, or when you receive a new message from the Security Expert. This can be set up through tools like Slack and Microsoft Teams, but you can also receive notifications via email or directly on the Conviso Platform.

By enabling notifications, a Manager can quickly respond to emerging security concerns, monitor the status of critical assets in real time, and ensure that the development team is aware of and can address security issues efficiently, fostering proactive and continuous application security.

[Click here](../../integrations/integrations_intro#communication-and-notification) to enable notifications through integrations or [click here](https://app.convisoappsec.com/spa/user/notifications-center) to activate email/in-app notifications.

### What is an Asset?

An Asset refers to any entity that can be evaluated for security purposes. This includes applications, microservices, repositories, or any software component that is subject to security analysis. Assets serve as the foundational elements within the platform, linking scan results, vulnerabilities, risk scores, and related security data. By managing assets effectively, users can track and prioritize security efforts based on factors such as business impact, attack surface, and data classification.

All scan information is linked to Assets in Conviso Platform. To view your Assets, click on "Asset Management" in the sidebar. By default, the Assets are listed from highest to lowest Risk Score.

:::note
Risk Score provides a holistic view of an asset's risk based on factors such as open vulnerabilities, attack surface, business impact, and data classification. Understanding the real risk of each asset is crucial for informed decision-making and prioritizing security efforts.
:::

<div style={{textAlign: 'center'}}>

</div>

To see more details about an Asset, simply click on its name.

From the Asset details page, you can [schedule a DAST execution](../security-scans/conviso-dast/conviso-dast.md), view the [vulnerabilities](../platform/vulnerabilities.md), the [SBOM](../security-scans/conviso-sbom/conviso-sbom.md), the [Risk Score](#understanding-risk-score), and various other information.

### Understanding Risk Score

The Risk Score on Conviso Platform is a crucial metric that enables Managers to prioritize and address potential security issues effectively. It evaluates the risk of each Asset by analyzing key factors: Business Impact, Threats, Attack Surface, and Data Classification.
- Business Impact reflects the criticality of an Asset, determined by indicators such as developer activity.
- Threats represent the active vulnerabilities associated with the Asset.
- Attack Surface assesses the exposure level, considering if the Asset is accessible over the internet.
- Data Classification identifies whether the Asset handles sensitive data, like PII.

With this comprehensive view, Managers can understand the overall security posture, track changes over time, and focus on actions to mitigate risks. The visibility of top high-risk and improving Assets, along with guidance on how to reduce risk, supports efficient and informed decision-making.

### View SBOM Information

An SBOM (Software Bill of Materials) is a detailed list of all components, libraries, and dependencies used in an application. It is crucial for building secure applications as it helps identify potential vulnerabilities and ensures transparency in software composition.

When accessing an Asset, you can view its SBOM by clicking the View all button:

<div style={{textAlign: 'center'}}>

![img](../../static/img/quickstart/developer6.png)

</div>

Here, you can explore your Assetâ€™s dependencies, including details like component version, technology, license, package manager, associated CVEs, and open vulnerabilities for each component.

<div style={{textAlign: 'center'}}>

![img](../../static/img/quickstart/developer7.png)

</div>

To learn more about Conviso SBOM, click [here](../security-suite/conviso-sbom/conviso-sbom.md).

## View Vulnerability Information on the Platform

Finally, the details of vulnerabilities can also be viewed directly on Conviso Platform. There are two main ways to access this information:

- Viewing from an Asset's detail page;
- Viewing from the sidebar menu.

### Viewing from an Asset's Detail Page

On the Asset detail page, simply click on the "Open Vulnerabilities" button, as highlighted in the image below:

<div style={{textAlign: 'center'}}>

![img](../../static/img/quickstart/developer4.png)

</div>

This action will filter for all Asset vulnerabilities with the status Identified, In Progress, or Awaiting Validation. From there, locate the relevant vulnerability and click on its title.

### Viewing from the Sidebar Menu

Alternatively, you can navigate via the sidebar by clicking on "Vulnerabilities," as shown in the image below:

<div style={{textAlign: 'center'}}>

![img](../../static/img/quickstart/developer5.png)

This way, you can easily prioritize which vulnerabilities should be fixed. To do this, simply click on the line related to **Sensitive Data**, as indicated below:

<div style={{textAlign: 'center'}}>

![img](../../static/img/quickstart/developer10.png)

</div>

Once you've accessed the vulnerability, you can view general information such as description, solution, and references. Depending on the vulnerability type, you may also find the vulnerable code snippet, file name, and line number. Other types of vulnerabilities may display different details, like the request made to exploit the vulnerability and the server's response, for example.

The Risk Context Prioritization Funnel provides Managers with a clear, data-driven approach to focus their efforts on the most critical vulnerabilities. By highlighting issues that have the highest impact on business and security, this feature enables more effective risk mitigation, ensuring that the most pressing threats are addressed first and that resources are used efficiently to strengthen the organization's security posture.
