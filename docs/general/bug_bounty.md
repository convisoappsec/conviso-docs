## Introduction

This feature is intended to enable the customer to create an internal "bug bounty" program and make it available to the users they want, whether it is the company's own analyst or developers.

## Bug Bounty Program configuration

To use the **Bug Bounty** program feature, we need to configure vulnerability scores for:

- Low Severity Vulnerability;

- Average Severity Vulnerability ;

- High Severity Vulnerability ;

- Critical Severity Vulnerability;

Log in to the [Conviso Platform](https://app.convisoappsec.com);

On the top bar menu, click on your **Company** Name. On the opened panel, click on the **Bug Bounty** tab, then click on the **Edit** button:

<div style={{textAlign: 'center'}}>

Assign values to the four levels of Vulnerability Severity. When done editing the vulnerabilities severities values, click on the **Save** button to store your configuration settings:
