Weâ€™ve made managing security projects in the Conviso Platform more powerful and intuitive! This update introduces streamlined workflows, enhanced validation, and greater flexibility, helping you stay in control of your security projects with ease.

This update brings significant improvements to project management. You can easily start, complete, and attach files to activities with a full requirements history. Project creation and editing have been simplified with enhanced flows and support for new project types like API, IoT, and AI Penetration Testing. You can add and edit comments directly on the project details page, improving communication and collaboration. Now we have a bulk status update. Plus, the overall user experience has been enhanced.

Take advantage of these improvements to manage your security projects more efficiently than ever!

**_Improved Feature_**

## Conviso AST 2.3.0


AST now uses Semgrep as the main scanner, with a rule management system powered by Conviso, enabling more precise and customizable security scans. Older scanners will remain available during a transition period to ensure vulnerabilities are properly addressed, preventing premature closure of issues actively being fixed.

More reliability, usability, and speed in your security workflow!


**_Improved Feature_**
## Save Filters in the Vulnerability Screen


<div style={{textAlign:'center'}}>

</div>


Users can personalize their vulnerability management experience by setting the "Vulnerabilities" page to display the most relevant vulnerabilities for their role or team by default, improving overall productivity and efficiency.
