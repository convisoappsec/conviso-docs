## What's New

Welcome to our first 2023 product release note! We are constantly implementing changes to optimize user experience on our platform and to integrate it even more with the developer's ecosystem.

### Import SARIF results into Conviso CLI

We have included a new feature to import results in SARIF format into the Conviso CLI. This update provides more flexibility to our platform to import external scan results that work with this format, meaning better use of the developer's manual work. 
Check [our documentation](https://docs.convisoappsec.com/cli/findings/#import-findings) to learn more. 


## Bug Fixes

To make Conviso Platform a more reliable product, these are some bugs that we fixed recently:

- Users reported that an asset integrated with Fortify was failing to sync. Our team fixed this bug;
- Findings generated by Dependency Track were not being promoted to vulnerabilities. The bug has been fixed;
- We also fixed an error that was occurring when creating an asset and running a scan without the SAST or SAST and DAST options selected.
