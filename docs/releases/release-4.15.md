## Risk Governance Improvements

- Set Follow-up Dates for Accepted Risks  
  When you accept a security risk, you can now set a reminder date for when it should be reviewed again. This helps ensure that accepted risks don't get forgotten and are reassessed when appropriate.

- Enforce Reanalysis Date for Risk Accepted  
  Complementing the previous change, this update enforces business rules to ensure that all "Risk Accepted" vulnerabilities are properly time-bound with a follow-up date.

  Vulnerabilities detected in container scans are now automatically closed if matching resolution criteria are metâ€”reducing manual effort and improving data hygiene.

- Automatic Sync for DAST Results  
  Ensure up-to-date vulnerability data by automatically syncing results from DAST sources at defined intervals.
