</div>

Yes! We heard you and we are glad to announce the release of a brand new native integration with Sonarcloud.

This integration consolidates scan results of applications in Sonarcloud with Conviso Platform, keeping both solutions synced in real time.

It supports a two-way integration regarding new vulnerabilities and status mapping, so every update in Sonarcloud will also update Conviso Platform, as well as updates in the triage of vulnerabilities within Conviso Platform vulnerability management, specifically for False Positives and Accepted Risks transitions.

Aggregating Sonarcloud results and other security tools with Conviso Platform will let you have a centralized view for a more efficient prioritization and security risk management of your applications.

We are also exited to introduce a brand-new native integration with Sonarqube, the on-premise version of Sonarcloud.

Similar as Sonarcloud, this integration consolidates scan results of applications in Sonarqube with Conviso Platform, keeping both solutions synced in real time.

It supports a two-way integration regarding new vulnerabilities and status mapping, so every update in Sonarqube will also update Conviso Platform, as well as updates in the triage of vulnerabilities within Conviso Platform vulnerability management, specifically for False Positives and Accepted Risks transitions.

Aggregating Sonarqube results and other security tools with Conviso Platform will let you have a centralized view for a more efficient prioritization and security risk management of your applications.

For a better and more efficient way to manage user access, now you can define a Profile and Access to a team so, users will automatically inherit those permissions and accesses of the team.

With this new feature you don't need to configure access control user by user anymore!
