We're excited to introduce SAML Group Mapping into the user management workflow, making it easier than ever to manage user access and permissions. With this new feature, administrators can automatically map users to specific groups within the Conviso Platform based on their SAML attributes, simplifying the assignment of roles and permissions across your organization.

### Key features:
- **Automated Group Mapping:** Simplify user management by mapping Conviso Platform groups to groups in your customer's Active Directory, such as Entra ID, through the SAML 2.0 protocol, reducing the need for manual intervention.
- **Consistent Access Control:** Ensure that users have the right access to the appropriate resources by aligning their group memberships in the Conviso Platform with those in your organization’s directory via SAML 2.0.
- **Customizable Mappings:** Define and manage group mappings that align with your organization’s structure, allowing you to flexibly assign user roles and permissions based on your specific needs.

The SAML Group Mapping feature enhances our existing user management capabilities, helping you maintain consistent and secure access control across your platform. This update is part of our ongoing efforts to deliver powerful tools that simplify administration and bolster security.<br></br><br></br>
