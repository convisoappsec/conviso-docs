## Introduction

This release brings multiple AI-powered capabilities, language flexibility, and major usability upgrades.  
Highlights include **multilingual reports**, **contextual AI fixes**, **enhanced retest workflows**, and expanded **threat modeling intelligence**.  
These updates aim to make the Conviso Platform faster, more intuitive, and even more powerful for global security teams.


**_New Feature_**
## Threat Modeling Agent (AI-Powered)

- New **AI-driven threat modeling agent** available in the Threat Modeling module.  
- The AI agent supports this input formats for modeling:  
  - **Images:** PNG, JPEG, and PDF architectural diagrams.  
  - **User Stories:** Markdown (`.md`) or plain text (`.txt`) files.
- Automatically recognizes and models assets from both visual and textual sources.
- The agent parses the file, identifies components, and generates **CAPEC-based security requirements** automatically.  
- Examples include disabling GraphQL introspection, enforcing rate limiting, and query cost analysis.  
- Helps standardize and accelerate threat modeling with minimal manual input.
