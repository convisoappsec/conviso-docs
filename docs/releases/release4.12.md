You can now track MTTR by severity, total vulnerabilities, and the top 10 issues, with time filters and a consolidated view of your security posture.

- MTTR by severity on Dashboard: View the Mean Time to Remediate (MTTR) by severity level and identify remediation bottlenecks. 
- "In the last X days" on all charts: See the time period directly on the charts without needing to apply filters. 
- Top 10 vulnerabilities: A quick view of the most recurring vulnerabilities to help prioritize actions. 
- Total vulnerabilities displayed: A consolidated overview of your applicationâ€™s security posture.
