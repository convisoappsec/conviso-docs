## What's New


**_New Feature_**

## Checkmarx Integration

</div>


We are exited to introduce a brand-new native integration with Checkmarx.

This integration consolidates scan results of applications in Checkmarx with Conviso Platform, keeping both solutions synced in real time.
It supports a two-way integration regarding new vulnerabilities and status mapping, so every update in Checkmarx will also update Conviso Platform, as well as updates in the triage of vulnerabilities within Conviso Platform vulnerability management, specifically for False Positives and Accepted Risks transitions.
Aggregating Checkmarx results and other security tools with Conviso Platform will let you have a centralized view for a more efficient prioritization and security risk management of your applications.

## Azure Boards Integration

</div>

Yes! We heard you and we are glad to announce the release of a native integration with Azure Boards.

Integrating Azure Boards in Conviso Platform will let developers gain productivity while we do all the hard work by automating the whole vulnerability management triage process.

New vulnerabilities identified in Conviso Platfom are created in real time directly in Azure Boards.
With our two-way integration capability, every status update from both solutions are automatically updated in order to reduce the toil and increase productivity.
