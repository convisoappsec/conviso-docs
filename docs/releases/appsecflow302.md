The platform has released a new version, with some features that will help our customers with some troubles.

## New Features

- Playbooks;

- Assets importing;

- New integrations (Qualys, Sonarqube, Fortify, Slack, Github, Nessus, Datasets, Veracode, Amazon Inspector and Trello);

## Benefits

The **Playbook** aims to help large teams working with the same goals, following a pattern within a process. Playbooks allow you to create an action plan based on tasks that must be carried out; in some cases they can be placed as mandatory for project closure, which guarantees the manager control over the execution.

The **Assets Importing** is a feature that we created for the user to import their assets from platforms and .csv file. With the assets registered in Appsec Flow, the customer has a vision of the life cycle of each asset, facilitating the follow-up and monitoring of possible weaknesses.
