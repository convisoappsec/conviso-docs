## Introduction

This release focuses on strengthening visibility into scans, simplifying user access, expanding reporting options,
and boosting platform performance. Highlights include **scan execution details**, **executive PDF reports**, **threat modeling automation**, and significant **frontend performance improvements**.

**_New Feature_**
## Scan Execution Details

- New dedicated page for each executed scanner (e.g., DAST, AST).  
- Provides details such as: execution date, duration, open/closed vulnerabilities, and execution history.  
- **DAST-specific:** shows all scanned URLs in a paginated table (example: 124 URLs).  
  - Upcoming: URL status (success/error).  
- Error messages are displayed in case of failures.  
- Available across all scanners.

**_New Feature_**
## Auto Unlock for Inactive Users

- Users inactive for 30+ days were previously locked and had to request manual unlock from support/admins.  
- Now, if users are inactivated, they can self-unlock via an email link, restoring access instantly.
- Reduces friction and dependency on support/admin.

## Dependency-Track Webhook Integration

- Automatic sync of assets when a new vulnerability is created in Dependency-Track.  
- Removes need for manual syncs by clients.  
- Ensures assets in Conviso Platform always reflect the most updated vulnerability context.

- Workflow:  
  - Upload architecture in **draw.io** format.  
  - Agent parses the architecture and generates security requirements.  
  - Based on **CAPEC**, requirements are created per component.  
- Benefits: speeds up threat modeling, provides standardized requirements, reduces manual effort.
