By default, the dashboards are filtered to show the last 30 days. You can change this to any date range you prefer. You can also filter the dashboard information by assets, vulnerability statuses, vulnerability severities and asset tags.

There are four different types of dashboards available:
1. AppSec Posture;
2. AppSec KPIs;
3. Secure Code Metrics;
4. Legacy Dashboard.
