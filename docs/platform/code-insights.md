## Introduction

The **Code Insights** module in the Conviso Platform offers a powerful way to analyze your entire codebase, focusing on inspecting assets in a secure virtual environment.
This feature provides deep visibility into your code, allowing you to analyze vulnerabilities based on the specific context of your asset.

### Prerequisites

Before you can use **Code Insights**, ensure that:

- You have at least one asset integrated with [GitHub](../integrations/github.md) or [Conviso AST](../security-scans/conviso-ast/conviso-ast.md)

## Usage

The **Code Insights** module helps you maintain a secure codebase by providing:

- In-depth analysis of your codebase
- Detection of vulnerabilities and unsafe coding patterns
- Continuous monitoring to ensure ongoing code security

### Locate the Configured Asset

To access **Code Insights**, locate the configured asset that has an integration with **GitHub** or **Conviso AST**, and navigate to **More Details > Code Insights**, and click **View**.
