## Introduction

Manage attached files in Conviso Platform. This feature allows you to securely share files with Conviso's Security Experts, ensuring a safe way to grant access to sensitive information that needs to be shared, such as application source code and vulnerability reports, for example.
This ensures control over who should have access to this critical information.

## Creating Attachments

</div>

Next, click on **New Attachment** to start setting up your file attachment:

<div style={{textAlign: 'center'}}>
