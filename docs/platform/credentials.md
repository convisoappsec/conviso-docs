## Introduction

Conviso Platform has a complete workflow for vulnerability management, such as the process cycle to evaluate, remediate, and mitigate security weaknesses in systems or applications.

## Creating Credentials
To register a credential, in the main left menu, click on **your company's name (1)**, **Resources (2)** and **Credentials (3)**:

<div style={{textAlign: 'center'}}>

</div>

Next, click on **New Credential** to start creating your credential:

<div style={{textAlign: 'center'}}>

![img](../../static/img/platform/credentials-img2.png "Credentials.")

</div>

Fill in the mandatory form fields:
- Name: A label to identify your credential;
- User: The username you will use;
- Password: The username password;
- Profile: The user profile;
- Environment: The environment where this credential will be used;
If you wish to better describe you credential purposes, use the optional **Description** text box to set a brief description of your credential. When done filling the form, click on the **Save** button to store your new credential:

<div style={{textAlign: 'center'}}>

![img](../../static/img/platform/credentials-img3.png "Credentials.")

</div>

<div style={{textAlign: 'center'}}>

![img](../../static/img/platform/credentials-img4.png "Credentials.")

</div>

## Using credentials in Projects

To add an existing credential to a new or an existing project, create (or edit) a project.
In the project configuration form, check the option **Will credentials be provided? (1)**, and then select the credential filled in the previous steps in the **Credentials label (2)**, as shown in the image below. It is possible to fill in more than one credential in this text box:

<div style={{textAlign: 'center'}}>

![img](../../static/img/platform/credentials-img5.png "Credentials.")

</div>
