## Introduction
People & Culture plays a **key role in culturally transforming** development teams, promoting the adoption of secure practices and awareness of the importance of application security. 

As a valuable tool in this process, the main objective of People & Culture is to facilitate **continuous learning** and allow the improvement of the necessary skills to deal with day-to-day challenges. 

People and Culture also elevate the learning experience through **immersive gamification** elements. 
 
Our Just in Time Training approach allows you to **choose training plans based on identified vulnerabilities**, ensuring that you receive the training that makes the most sense for the code correction you need to apply. This means you can choose the specific training modules that are relevant to your current development challenges, ensuring that you are equipped with the right knowledge at the right time.

### Prerequisite
To access People & Culture, it is necessary to initiate a contract for using this product, see here to [contact the responsible team](https://bit.ly/43abLIy).

## Usage
Conviso Platform offers a seamless integration between training and practice, providing developers with the necessary skills to efficiently deal with identified vulnerabilities in applications. 

Within this platform, you will find an exclusive section dedicated to Vulnerability Management:

<div style={{textAlign: 'center'}}>

![img](../../static/img/people-and-culture-img1.png)

</div>

In this section, you will have access to a complete view of the vulnerabilities present in your applications.  The People & Culture differential is that, when managing vulnerabilities, you can use the training to study the identified vulnerabilities.

This allows you to choose the training modules that make the most sense for the vulnerabilities you need to address, ensuring you can sharpen your application security skills in a targeted and effective way. By focusing on the specific challenges related to the vulnerabilities you find, you can better prepare yourself to handle them with confidence.

To access the secure coding trails, click the "People & Culture" option in the left-hand menu:

## Exploring your Education Journey Labs

<div style={{textAlign: 'center'}}>

![img](../../static/img/people-and-culture-img10.png)

</div>

This feature provides a **curated list of technologies**, each representing a unique knowledge track in secure coding for developers.

Within each technology track, you'll find a wealth of hands-on exercises and challenges designed to sharpen your skills and deepen your understanding of secure coding practices. 

Keep track of your progress with the convenient completion **progress bar** displayed alongside each technology. This percentage-based progress bar provides a clear visual representation of how far you've come in completing all the exercises within a specific technology track.

### Lab Technologies
You can explore a variety of technologies to enhance your secure coding skills. 

The available technologies include **iOS, Smart Contracts, Server Hardening, Scala, SQL, Ruby, QA Security Testing, Python, Pseudocode, PHP, NodeJS, Kubernetes, Kotlin, Java, Go Lang, Frontend, Exploitation, Docker, COBOL, C, Apex, Android, AWS, ABAP, and .NET**. 

### Learning path for your language or technology

By clicking on one of the available technologies, an exercise trail will appear for you:

<div style={{textAlign: 'center'}}>

![img](../../static/img/people-and-culture-img11.png)

</div>

This lab is designed to provide a structured and engaging learning experience. It guides you through exercises focused on addressing specific vulnerabilities, gradually increasing in difficulty as you progress. 

Within this interface, you will find the following columns:

- **Status**: Indicates the progress of each exercise in the Learn Path.

- **Technology**: Specifies the programming language or technology associated with the exercises in the labs.

- **Vulnerability Title**: Each exercise is associated with a specific vulnerability that needs to be addressed. 

- **Difficulty Level**:  Represents the complexity of the exercise. It is indicated by a star rating system, with one star indicating an easy exercise, three stars representing a moderate level of difficulty, and five stars denoting a challenging exercise.

- **Duration**: Specifies the time limit allocated to complete the exercise.

- **Score**: Represents the points awarded for completing the exercise.

- **Action**: It features a play button that you can click to start the exercise and dive into solving the presented vulnerability.

By clicking on start, you will be able to solve the exercise. [See here how to solve an exercise in People & Culture](../people-and-culture/solving-code-review.md).

Completing exercises, you enhance your understanding of secure coding practices and strengthen your ability to mitigate vulnerabilities effectively.

## Solving practical exercises in the virtualized development environment

In People & Culture, when you click on a chosen technology, you can access an exercise path. For this example, we will use the "Pseudocode" track.
