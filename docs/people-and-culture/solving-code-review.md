## Introduction
This guide is designed to help you navigate the process of effectively solving exercises and enhancing your secure coding skills within the People & Culture.

By engaging in hands-on exercises, you can put your knowledge into practice and develop a deeper understanding of secure coding techniques. Each exercise presents a specific vulnerability or coding challenge requiring attention and problem-solving abilities.

### Prerequisite
To access People & Culture, it is necessary to initiate a contract for using this product, see here to [contact the responsible team](https://bit.ly/43abLIy).

## Solving practical exercises in the virtualized development environment
In People & Culture, when you click on a chosen technology, you can access an exercise path. For this example, we will use the "Pseudocode" track.

<div style={{textAlign: 'center'}}>

</div>

**Note:** Pseudocode is a high-level, simplified programming language that focuses on expressing algorithms and logic without strict adherence to any specific programming language syntax.

When solving security problem exercises, the Pseudocode track can be an excellent suggestion for beginners. 

### Step 1: Choosing the exercise
So let's choose an easy-level exercise for our example:

<div style={{textAlign: 'center'}}>

</div>

It is possible to identify the difficulty through the number of stars in "level". Generally, easy exercises have a short duration and low scores. 

To select exercises, prioritize the **technologies** and **vulnerabilities** suggested in the People & Culture panel. By aligning your exercises with the platform's indications, you can effectively enhance your skills in the most relevant areas of secure coding for your company.

Everyone starts somewhere, and every beginning is a chance to learn and grow!

### Step 2: Accessing the exercise
To get started, simply click on the "Start" button in the Actions column:

<div style={{textAlign: 'center'}}>

![img](../../static/img/people-and-culture-img14.png)

</div>

After starting, a new tab will appear. In this window, a message will ask you to accept the "Licence Agreement":

<div style={{textAlign: 'center'}}>

</div>

**Note:** The license is a legal agreement between you and Conviso for using SecureFlag software and services and any materials or documents made available by us through our platform (collectively referred to as the Service). 

After accepting the terms of the "License Agreement," you will then have access to the exercise environment.

It is important to pay attention, the countdown has already started, and you can run out of time from now on! 


In People & Culture, when you click on a chosen technology, you can access an exercise path. For this example, we will use the "Pseudocode" track.

[AppSec training through People & Culture](https://bit.ly/43kEQk6): We know that we need to develop applications with security to avoid the numerous threats of everyday life. However, how to carry out this work with the development team without training in AppSec?

[The Role of Education in AppSec Culture](https://bit.ly/42ZSMAg): Implementing application security practices in a company goes far beyond performing tasks. Itâ€™s a culture to be cultivated. In this journey, education is a fundamental step.
