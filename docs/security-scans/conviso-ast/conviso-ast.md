## Introduction

Scan and protect your codebase with Conviso AST, a combination of open source scanners for SAST, SCA, Secrets Detection and IaC.

**[At Conviso, we believe that AppSec goes beyond security tools, and we offer a comprehensive approach that includes consulting, training, and support services.](https://cta-service-cms2.hubspot.com/web-interactives/public/v1/track/redirect?encryptedPayload=AVxigLKtcWzoFbzpyImNNQsXC9S54LjJuklwM39zNd7hvSoR%2FVTX%2FXjNdqdcIIDaZwGiNwYii5hXwRR06puch8xINMyL3EXxTMuSG8Le9if9juV3u%2F%2BX%2FCKsCZN1tLpW39gGnNpiLedq%2BrrfmYxgh8G%2BTcRBEWaKasQ%3D&webInteractiveContentId=125788977029&portalId=5613826)**

## Objective


With Conviso AST, you can analyze your source code and consolidate the results in Conviso Platform Vulnerability management module.
We utilize a unified security engine featuring Semgrep with Conviso-managed rules, this engine aggregates and deduplicates scan results.

## SAST
Currently we support the following languages using Semgrep with Conviso managed rules:

- C#
- Go
- Java
- JavaScript
- Kotlin
- Python
- Typescript
- C / C++
- JSX
- Ruby
- Scala
- Swift
- Rust
- PHP
- Generic
- JSON

:::note
Elixir is not yet supported by Semgrep. We use Sobelow, enhanced with Conviso-managed generic Semgrep rules, for Elixir security scans.
:::

## SCA
Conviso AST also analyzes the dependencies of your application and identifies vulnerable ones that need to be updated.
For SCA, Conviso AST uses [OSV Scanner](https://github.com/google/osv-scanner). 

## IaC
We also support infrastructure as a code security scans to identify possible security problems in different types of technolgies as Terraform, Ansible, Kubernetes, and many more.
For IaC, Conviso AST uses [Checkov](https://github.com/bridgecrewio/checkov).

## Secrets Detection
Start checking for exposed credentials, api keys or tokens in your source code.
For Secret Detection, Conviso AST uses [Gitleaks](https://github.com/gitleaks/gitleaks)

## How to use Conviso AST?

Scan directly from your terminal with [**Conviso CLI**](../../cli/installation) and combine other capabilities such as: 

- Set policies to block the pipeline depending on different criteria;
- Send diff versions of your source code application to later be reviewed by your own security team or - Conviso's (when subscribed to our professional services license).
- Auto-close open vulnerabilities on the platform that are no longer identified during its execution, and can reopen them if they were closed but identified later.

**Conviso AST integrates with all the major CI/CD tools in the market**, whether on Github Actions, Gitlab, Jenkins, and many others; **discover[ our integrations here](../../integrations/integrations_intro)**.

The analysis results are sent to Conviso Platform, where you can view, prioritize and fix the vulnerabilities found using our **[Vulnerabilities](../../platform/vulnerabilities)** feature.

## How to fix a vulnerability with Conviso AST?

Conviso AST can automatically detect when a vulnerability in the Conviso Platform has been fixed and update its status. After correcting a vulnerability in your code, rerun the Conviso scan, making sure to use the following command:

```bash
conviso ast run --vulnerability-auto-close
```

By using this feature, the vulnerability status will be automatically updated. You will see a message indicating that the tool has identified the vulnerability as fixed.
