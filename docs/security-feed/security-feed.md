## Introduction

The Security Feed is an essential feature of the [Conviso Platform](https://cta-service-cms2.hubspot.com/web-interactives/public/v1/track/redirect?encryptedPayload=AVxigLKtcWzoFbzpyImNNQsXC9S54LjJuklwM39zNd7hvSoR%2FVTX%2FXjNdqdcIIDaZwGiNwYii5hXwRR06puch8xINMyL3EXxTMuSG8Le9if9juV3u%2F%2BX%2FCKsCZN1tLpW39gGnNpiLedq%2BrrfmYxgh8G%2BTcRBEWaKasQ%3D&webInteractiveContentId=125788977029&portalId=5613826), designed to provide users with real-time AppSec insights and actionable information related to their application security.

It serves as a centralized hub of knowledge, helping users understand the current state of their company's security and guiding them on what actions to enhance to [improve their application security](https://blog.convisoappsec.com/afinal-o-que-e-seguranca-de-aplicacoes/). 

## Usage
To access the Security Feed, simply click on the **“Home”** icon located in the left-hand corner menu:

Upon access, you will encounter the following essential features. These are designed to provide users with relevant information and enable them to perform vital security-related tasks efficiently..

## Discover Your Application's Risk: Overall Risk Score

Our feature offers a comprehensive and real-time view of your application security posture, making it an essential component of [Application Security Program Management (ASPM)](XX). A higher risk score signals a greater level of potential security threats, prompting users to prioritize and address security issues promptly. 

In addition, this feature includes a dynamic graphical representation that allows users to **filter** the risk score for the last 30 days or more, enabling them to monitor security trends and proactively manage their assets' risk.
