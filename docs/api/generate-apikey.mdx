To generate your user's API_KEY key, log on to Conviso Platform and go to the "Edit Profile" in the upper right corner, as shown in the image below:

<ImageDisplay imagePath='/img/apikey-img1.png' />

:::note
This key can be generated as many times as you wish. However, the previously generated key will lose its usefulness.
:::

After clicking on **Edit Profile**, then click on the **API Key** tab, and then on the **Generate** button to generate your key, as in the following image:

<ImageDisplay imagePath='/img/apikey-img2.png' />

After clicking on **Generate**, click on **Confirm** for your key to be generated successfully.

<ImageDisplay imagePath='/img/apikey-img3.png' />

After clicking on **Confirm**, the confirmation of your new API Key will appear with its respective value. We recommend storing this API Key somewhere safe as a password vault.

<ImageDisplay imagePath='/img/apikey-img4.png' />

Once you have your API Key properly stored, click **OK, close** and the **Save** button.
