## Introduction
To perform activities with Conviso CLI, Conviso Platform Integrations and also Conviso API, it is important to generate an API Key to authenticate your user. 

## Usage
Follow these steps as shown in the gif:

1. Log in to Conviso Platform and go to **"Edit Profile"** in the upper right corner;
2. Click on API Key tab and **Generate** button to create your key;
3. Click **Confirm** after generating the key for successful creation.

</div>

After clicking on **Confirm**, the confirmation of your new API Key will appear with its respective value. We recommend storing this API Key somewhere safe as a password vault.

**Note:** This key can be generated as many times as you wish. However, the previously generated key will expire.
